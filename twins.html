<h3>The Hero Twins</h3>
<p> The story of the Hero Twins is one of the most famous in Mayan mythology. Hunahpu and Xbalanque are demigods who undertake a series of challenges in the underworld, Xibalba, after their father and uncle were defeated by the lords of Xibalba. The twins use their wits to outsmart the underworld gods, eventually resurrecting their father, who becomes the Maize God. This tale is symbolic of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, as well as the triumph of good over evil.
