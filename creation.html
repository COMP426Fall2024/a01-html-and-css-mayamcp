<p>The Mayan Creation story is found in the Popol Vuh, a sacred text covering the mythology and history of the K'iche' people of the Maya. It contains other tales as well as the story of creation, and is valued due to the fact that it is one of the few existing accounts of Mesoamerican mythology from their own perspective, rather than that of the colonizers.</p>

  <tr>
      <td>Creation</td>
     <td>The gods (Hurak√°n plus six other deities) create the world from the void. They create plants and animals to inhabit the earth, but they could not speak or worship. Thus, they desired to create "humans."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>1st Attempt</td>
      <td>The gods first made humans from earth and mud. However, these creations kept falling apart, and, being earth, they were essentially destroyed when exposed to water.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>2nd Attempt</td>
      <td>The gods attempted to create humans again, this time from wood. Unlike with the mud people, they were sturdy. However, they did not worship and respect their creators as desired. So, they were made to die, with the gods sending a massive flood followed by monsters and wild animals. Any of these creation that remained after this are said to be the origin of monkeys.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>3rd Attempt</td>
      <td>One last time, humans are created, this time from maize, becoming the successful creation. This highlights the importance of corn or maize to the Maya. This final creation is the human race we know today (plus a few tweaks, but you can explore that on your own.)</td>
