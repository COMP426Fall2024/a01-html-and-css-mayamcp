  <h3>Who Are the Maya?</h3>
  <p>The Maya people originate from the ancient Maya Civilization, which covered parts of modern-day Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador, as well as the entirety of Guatemala and Belize. Scholars believe the beginnings of the Mayans began around 2600 BC in modern Belize. Overtime, cultivation of crops such as maize and beans allowed settlements to expand. Eventually, these settlements developed into villages and eventually larger cities.</p>
  <p>The height of the Maya civilization started around 250 AD and continued for several centuries. Some of the largest cities are estimated to have had anywhere from 50,000 to 120,000 residents. Things began to collapse around 250 AD for a number of reasons, including overpopulation, drought, and warfare. However, a significantly smaller presence remained even after the collapse of the larger civilization, and would remain relatively consistent until Spanish colonizers began their conquest, eventually leading to the end of what is considered the Mayan civilization.</p>
  <p>Despite this, Mayan culture and history manages to persist today, both through artifacts and relics of history, as well as the ancestors of the ancient Mayan people. Today, they have over 6 million descendants who primarily reside in the same areas and speak one or more of the many Mayan languages. Through a combination of these factors, we can examine the fascinating culture of the Maya, particularly some of their mythology.</p>
