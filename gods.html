<p>Like many Mesoamerican indigenous groups, the Maya were polytheistic, meaning they believed in multiple gods/goddesses. Here are some of the most significant or interesting that are suspected to have existed. However, as with a lot of pre-colonial Indigenous history, a lot of this information is incomplete and potentially incorrect.
