<p>Unfortunately, I could only capture so much of these stories here. However, if you are interested, I highly recommend seeking out more information on Mayan mythology, as well as the Maya Civilzation in general. It is best to consult multiple reputable sources when looking into topics such as this one, since a significant amount of information is incorrect to colonizers erasing and misconstruing Indigenous culture. However, should you choose to pursue more info, you will see what made the Mayan civilization such an incredible force, as well as why the Maya name is a great one to bear.</p>
